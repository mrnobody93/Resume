<body>
    <h2>Summary:</h2><p>I am a Swedish guy located in Tokyo, with a passion for learning and a big interest in AI and computers.
        <br>I speak native level Swedish and English, and my Japanese is highly advanced.
        <br>Recently I have gotten into web-development and been learning how to code with HTML, CSS and Javascript. <br>There's also Python that I have been dabbling with a bit, and I am loving it so far.
        
        <br>Other than my newly aquired interest for programming, I really enjoy Philosophy, Psychology and also Music, Movies/Books and stories that deeply explore these topics.
    <br>My other main occupation has been working as an English teacher. Which also has been very rewarding.</p>
